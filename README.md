# prieto_figure_making
Plotting for characterization data. Include anything from figure making to Rietveld refinements. If you have a new code to make beautiful figures for papers, please share.
## Python Tutorial:
#### Coding basics, importing, processing, and plotting battery related data
#### Complied by Nathan Neisius
### Objective:
By working through this tutorial, I hope that anybody with no prior coding experience can learn the basic of how to code in Python, as well as apply that code to some practically relevant processing and plotting of some battery data that we commonly collect in the Prieto research group.
### Branches:
PXRD, IR, Battery, UV-Vis
### Jupyter Notebooks: (These are worksheets containing Python code to learn from)
Python Tutorial.ipynb,   Learning the basics of programing with python.ipynb,   IR Figure Making.ipynb,   Rietveld Refinement-Standard Code.ipynb,   PXRD Standard Code.ipynb

Useful Codes for Battery Data.ipynb
### Data Files: (These example data files will be used by the Jupyter notebooks)
Gamry_EIS_Data.DTA,
Arbin_Cycling_Data.xlsx
Arbin_Cycling_Data_2.xlsx
Arbin_Cycling_Data_3.xlsx
### The Tutorial:
The document “Python Tutorial.ipynb” is a Jupyter notebook that can be treated like a worksheet for
learning Python and its data processing and plotting capabilities. It walks you through basic ideas
behind coding by explaining what bits of code do before and after you run them. Occasionally it will
prompt you to try filling in places left intentionally blank. There are answers filled in to these
portions in the “Answers.ipynb” document should you get stuck.
While it is hopefully detailed enough that you should be able to work through it on your own,
working through it with myself or another person familiar with Python will probably be more
educational.
### Installing Python on your computer:
I recommend downloading the most recent version of Python using Anaconda Python environments:

https://www.anaconda.com/download (Versions are available through other sites, but Kelly and I are more familar with this platfrom)

https://store.enthought.com/downloads/ 

Both come with many easily installable or already installed packages with all kinds of scientific tools, some of which we use in the tutorial.
### Code Sharing and Passing Along Knowledge:
Because the whole point of using code is to save you time on your data processing and to make
sweet looking figures, I’ve included a bunch of codes that I’ve found useful in my own battery
related research in “Useful Codes for Battery Data.ipynb”. Feel free to use them as you will. Take
them and modify them as much as you’d like to fit your specific application. I’m sure they can be
modified to be useful on non-battery related data. If you learn something cool that improves the
code or does something new and cool, share it with others that might also be able to use it!
